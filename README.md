# Funny Sandbox — Interactive Toy Labs

A collection of small “toy” simulators and interactive labs built to communicate intuition
(fat tails, leverage effects, liquidations, skew/smile distortions, etc.).

## ⚠️ Scope (read first)
- Educational / communication tools only.
- Not an identification strategy. Not used to produce empirical results.
- Not risk-neutral pricing unless explicitly stated (e.g., Gaussian/Black–Scholes baseline).
- Not for trading or real risk management.

## Labs
- `leverage-fat-tails/` — Leverage & left-tail amplification + VaR/ES + liquidation probability (interactive HTML)

## Run locally
Each lab is a static page. Open `index.html`.
